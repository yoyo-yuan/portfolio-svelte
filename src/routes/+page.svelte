<h1>Yoyo Yuan</h1>
<p>
    Hi! I’m a sophomore at MIT majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have experience in
    software engineering, financial advisory, and quantitative trading. On campus, I serve as Banana
    Lead of the MIT Banana Lounge and as Room Assignment Chair in Maseeh Hall. I’m excited to continue
    exploring opportunities at the intersection of technology and finance.
